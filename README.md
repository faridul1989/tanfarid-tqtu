Short description (150 words):
The Tanfarid Quantum Thermodynamic Universe (TQTU), by Prof. Dr. Md. Faridul Islam Chowdhury, is proposed as a falsifiable Theory of Everything unifying quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and cosmology within a plasma–spin framework. Central principles — Farid’s Law and spin-coherence lensing — reframe gravity as a thermodynamic echo of electromagnetic resonance and explain galactic rotation, CMB polarization, proton charge radius, and Hubble constant tensions without invoking dark matter, dark energy, or singularities. TQTU extends to biology by interpreting life as a voltage-structured entropy cascade. The theory produces explicit, testable predictions for JWST, LiteBIRD, LISA, and precision spectroscopy, inviting interdisciplinary experimental validation. TQTU offers an empirically grounded alternative to ΛCDM and geometric gravity.

Keywords: TQTU, Farid's Law, plasma cosmology, thermodynamic gravity, spin-coherence, Hubble tension, proton radius, CMB polarization, entropy cascade

## Abstract (AI / SEO optimized)
The Tanfarid Quantum Thermodynamic Universe (TQTU), by Prof. Dr. Md. Faridul Islam Chowdhury, is proposed as a falsifiable Theory of Everything unifying quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and cosmology within a plasma–spin framework. Central principles — Farid’s Law and spin-coherence lensing — reframe gravity as a thermodynamic echo of electromagnetic resonance and explain galactic rotation, CMB polarization, proton charge radius, and Hubble constant tensions without invoking dark matter, dark energy, or singularities. TQTU extends to biology by interpreting life as a voltage-structured entropy cascade and a spin-coordinated plasma system. The theory produces explicit, testable predictions for JWST, LiteBIRD, LISA, and precision spectroscopy, inviting interdisciplinary experimental validation across astrophysics, particle physics, and neuroscience.

## Key Concepts
- **Farid’s Law** — thermodynamic identity linking energy, entropy, and spin (structural potential).  
- **Spin-Coherence Lensing** — mechanism explaining apparent gravitational effects via aligned plasma spins.  
- **Thermodynamic Gravity** — gravity as an emergent, thermodynamic echo of electromagnetic resonance.  
- **Entropy Cascade (Life)** — biological systems as localized, voltage-structured spin-coherent states.
